          <p>There is a fine line between regular use and drug abuse and   addiction. Very few addicts are able to recognize when they have crossed   that line. While frequency or the amount of drugs consumed do not   necessarily constitute drug abuse or addiction, they can often be   indicators of drug-related problems.</p>

          <ul type="disc">
            <li><strong>Drug abuse may start as a way to socially      connect. </strong>Commonly,   people try drugs for the first time in social situations with friends   and acquaintances. A strong desire to fit in to the group can make it   feel like doing the drugs with them is the only option.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Problems can sometimes sneak up on you,</strong> as   your drug use gradually increases over time. Smoking a joint with   friends over the weekend, or taking ecstasy at a rave, or cocaine at an   occasional party, for example, can change from using drugs a couple of   days a week to using them every day. Gradually, getting and using the   drug becomes more and more important to you.</li><br>
            <li><strong>If the drug fulfills a valuable need,</strong> you   may find yourself increasingly relying on it. You may take drugs to   calm or energize yourself, or make you more confident. You may start   using prescription drugs to cope with panic attacks or relieve chronic   pain. Until you find alternative, healthier methods for overcoming these   problems, your drug use will likely continue. If you are using drugs to   fill a void in your life, you&rsquo;re more at risk of crossing the line from   casual use to drug abuse and addiction. To maintain a healthy balance   in your life, you need to have positive experiences and feel good about   your life without any drug use.</li><br>
            <li><strong>As drug abuse takes hold,</strong> you   may miss or frequently be late for work or school, your job performance   may progressively deteriorate, and you may start to neglect social or   family responsibilities. Your ability to stop using is eventually   compromised. What began as a voluntary choice has turned into a physical   and psychological need.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Eventually drug abuse can consume </strong>your   life, stopping social and intellectual development. This only   reinforces the feelings of isolation that led to the drug use in the   first place. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The good news is that with the right   treatment and support, you can counteract the disruptive effects of drug   use and regain control of your life. The first obstacle is to recognize   and admit you have a problem, or listen to loved ones who are often   better able to see the negative effects drug use is having on your life.</p>

                <h3>Five myths about drug abuse and addiction</h3>
                <p><strong>MYTH 1: Overcoming addiction is simply a matter of willpower. You can stop using drugs if you really want to.</strong> Prolonged   exposure to drugs alters the brain in ways that result in powerful   cravings and a compulsion to use. These brain changes make it extremely   difficult to quit by sheer force of will.</p>
                <p> <strong>MYTH 2: Addiction is a disease; there&rsquo;s nothing that can be done about it.</strong> Most   experts agree that addiction is a disease that affects the brain, but   that doesn&rsquo;t mean anyone is a helpless victim. The brain changes   associated with addiction can be treated and reversed through therapy,   medication, exercise, and other treatments.</p>
                <p> <strong>MYTH 3: Addicts have to hit rock bottom before they can get better.</strong> Recovery   can begin at any point in the addiction process—and the earlier, the   better. The longer drug abuse continues, the stronger the addiction   becomes and the harder it is to treat. Don&rsquo;t wait to intervene until the   addict has lost everything.</p>
                <p> <strong>MYTH 4: You can&rsquo;t force someone into treatment; they have to want help.</strong> Treatment   doesn&rsquo;t have to be voluntary to be successful. People who are pressured   into treatment by their family, employer, or the legal system are just   as likely to benefit as those who choose to enter treatment on their   own. As they sober up and their thinking clears, many formerly resistant   addicts decide they want to change.</p>
                <p> <strong>MYTH 5: Treatment didn&rsquo;t work before, so there&rsquo;s no point trying again.</strong> Recovery   from drug addiction is a long process that often involves setbacks.   Relapse doesn&rsquo;t mean that treatment has failed or that sobriety is a   lost cause. Rather, it&rsquo;s a signal to get back on track, either by going   back to treatment or adjusting the treatment approach.</p>
